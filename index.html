	<p>Abstract</p>
	<p>An analysis looking at the relationship between how particular one is in choosing a partner, that is, 
		how specific one’s ideal match would be to their vision – and one’s word choice when talking about themselves. This idea was carried out by looking at an OKCupid dataset which provided anonymous information on it’s users in California., conducting sentiment analysis on multiple essays written by individuals, and comparing that to how specific they wanted their partner to be extracted the data. Moreover, subsets of age and education status were looked at to compare multiple aspects of data. We can conclude that despite their being no direct correlation between particularity and sentiments of self-description,
		the data clusters in groups when looking at different levels of education.</p>
